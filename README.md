# ViSOL Project

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

You must ensure that the configuration properties are set. This can be done in one of three ways:
1. Define a `config.properties` file in the directory where you run the project from.
2. Set the `visol.config.location` environment variable to the absolute path of the `config.properties` file.
3. Manually set all configuration properties as environment variables. Note that they must all be prefixed with `visol.config.`.

An example of an `config.properties` file is provided in the `config.properties.example` file.
